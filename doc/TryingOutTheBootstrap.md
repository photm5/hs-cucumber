# Trying out the bootstrap

I wrote this implementation using the [cucumber-bootstrap][1] method.  This
document shows you how to validate yourself that the tests actually pass.  I
assume you use the Nix package manager.

Assuming you are already in a temporary directory you want to try this out in,
first clone the two repositories:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-bootstrap
git clone https://github.com/shak-mar/TODO-fill-in-repository-name-here
```

Since there is a [problem][2] with json 1.6.1 and latest ruby versions, you may
want to apply a [patch][3] to use a newer version of json that fixes the
problem:

```sh
pushd cucumber-bootstrap
git am ../TODO-fill-in-repository-name-here/doc/supporting-files/bootstrap-Use-json-1.8.2.patch
popd
```

With a bit of prayer, the following bundler run will succeed, leaving you with
the required ruby things:

```sh
pushd cucumber-bootstrap
nix-shell -p bundler --run 'bundler --binstubs bin --path gems
popd
```

Next, compile the `cucino` binary I implemented in Haskell:

```sh
pushd TODO-fill-in-repository-name-here
nix-shell --run 'cabal build'
popd
```

Youâ€™re ready to go!  Try this:

```sh
pushd cucumber-bootstrap
nix-shell -p bundler ruby --run 'PATH=$PATH:../TODO-fill-in-repository-name-here/dist/build/cucino/ ./bin/cucumber'
popd
```
